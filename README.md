# YT ratio
A simple userscript to use like / dislike ratio of a visited Youtube video to build browsable rankings. The idea behind
this project was to see in an easy way which videos are well-received by the Youtube community.

Each time a video is visited, the likes, dislikes, their ratio, the view count and the url are stored in the local storage.
After this, rankings based on the view count and ratio are updated and are browsable by the user.

The rankings are separated accordingly to the number of views of a video, since it would make little sense to compare
a video with a big ratio but only something like 500 views and another video with a smaller ratio but more than a 
million views. In that way, the ranking of "popular" videos with a big view count are often more insteresting that those
concerning videos with a smaller view count.
